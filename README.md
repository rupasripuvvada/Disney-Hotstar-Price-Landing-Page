# Disney+Hotstar-Price-Landing-Page


### HTML Code:
The HTML structure defines a pricing landing page for Disney+ Hotstar subscriptions with three subscription options: Mobile, Super, and Premium. Each section provides details about the subscription and includes radio buttons to select the duration and a purchase button.

### CSS Code:
The CSS styles the page to be visually appealing and responsive:
- **Body and Header**: Sets a dark background and styles the header text.
- **Cards Layout**: Uses Flexbox to arrange the subscription cards, each with gradient backgrounds, rounded corners, and shadows.
- **Card Content**: Centers the text within the cards and styles the purchase buttons.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries adjust the layout for different screen sizes, ensuring the content is accessible on tablets and mobile devices.

### JavaScript Code:
The JavaScript adds interactivity to the purchase buttons:
- **Event Listeners**: Each purchase button has an event listener that triggers an alert when clicked.
- **Disable Other Buttons**: When a purchase button is clicked, the other buttons are disabled to ensure only one subscription can be purchased at a time.

### Summary:
The combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript create a responsive and interactive pricing page for Disney+ Hotstar, with a visually appealing design and functional purchase buttons that enhance user experience across various devices.
